# Gotham JS Framework

Gotham is a web application framework for front-end development. After crafting many web applications using Laravel and Rails I couldn't find a simple front-end framework to manage my Javascript. I wanted to code my front-end with an expressive syntax, install a package and use it without any pain. To require/include functions like you can in others languages, execute something when i need it, and do it all in an elegant, logical way.

Gotham was born.

# Official Documentation

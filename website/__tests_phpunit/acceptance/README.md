What to Include in your Acceptance Tests ?

Think as a simple user of the application:

When I click on X, I must see X
When I provide wrong informations to the form, I see some errors
When I click on my account, I want to see the details of my profile

etc ...

However these kind of tests breaks easily, don't spend so much time on it.

What to Include in your Integration Tests ?

Integration tests are used to test the interaction among any number of controllers. They are generally used to test important work flows within your application.

Examples: 
- As a guest I want to purchase a box
- As an admin I want to change the billing address of an user then I want to see if it's reflected in his account

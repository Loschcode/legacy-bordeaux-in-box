This repository is my biggest and last PHP project.

## History

We created a monthly delivery box company with two other associates and one graphic artist. The service grew well. We did multiple refactoring and integrated many different features, even did a marketing pivot.

After 1.5 year of nearly perfect technical flow, the financial aspect of the company catch up and we decided to give up.

## Development

We built a very customized shopping cart tailored to the needs of our delivery service.

We engineered systems to handle customer leads, order flow, a recurring payment system using stripe (>50 000 euros growth), and a module that programmatically fulfilled orders.

We also aggregated data that was collected from our users and build out a reporting module with several easy to understand graphs that helped to make sense of many complex and relational data sets (>2 000 orders).

## Technologies

Laravel 5.0
MySQL
SASS / CSStyle
Brunch / GothamJS

## Legacy

I decided to publish the repository of my former company so at least pieces of the code can be useful to coders. This is also a way to tell our story and live our mourning a little better.
